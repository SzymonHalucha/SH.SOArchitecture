This package is for the Unity engine, which provides an architecture based on ScriptableObjects. It simplifies development of modular and customizable games.

## Features

- **Easy data storage:** Store game data in ScriptableObjects that can be edited at runtime without compiling code.
- **Modular design:** Create modular game components that can be easily combined and reused.
- **Take advantage of reactive programming:** This architecture makes it easy to implement *Event Driven UI* approaches.
- **Work with a wide range of data types:** This package includes ready-to-use ScriptableObjects components for all C# primitive types and supports almost all types serialized by Unity.

## Installation

1. Open the package manager in the Unity engine.
2. Click on the add icon in the upper left corner of the manager and select *Add package from git URL...*.
3. Paste the following link: [https://github.com/SzymonHalucha/SH.SOArchitecture.git](https://github.com/SzymonHalucha/SH.SOArchitecture.git).
